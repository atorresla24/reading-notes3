## Version Control

* Allows you to revisit various verisons of a file or set of files
    - Can revert a file 
    - track modification
    - modify indivduals
    - compare changes
* Allowed for programmers to have more knowledge on team members' activity
* If CVS (centralized version control) goes down then people couldn't work together

## What is Git?

* Snapshots
    - DVCS (Distributed Version Control) that stores data in a file system made of snapshots
* Local Operations
    - Relies mainly on local operations because most necesarry information can be found in local resources
    - Allows for work to be done even if not online or on a VPN
* Tracking changes
    - All changes are tracked by Git
* States
    - Files reside in three main states
        - Committed-Data is securely stored in local databases
        - Modified-file has been changed but not committed to the database
        - Staged-Flagged a file's changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
* Git traces its roots to the open sourve software project Linux kernel
